    	<p>Annette Pramono is a fashion enthusiast with a focus on Wholesale and Merchandising. She sees finer things in daily life that often were unnoticed.
    	<p>The Long</p>
    	<p>When Annette was only 12 years old, she discovered her love for fashion when her mother took her various fashion shows. She found herself in awe looking at how a piece of fabric can create a spectacular show, making anyone feel beautiful about themselves. She grew up Indonesia and finally moved to New York to pursue her degree in Fashion Institute of Technology. She began her professional career doing wholesale and buying internships in fashion companies such as Steven Alan, Michael Kors, Jason Wu, Max Mara, and Thom Browne. She landed her first full-time job at a childrenswear manufacturer for Walmart and grew interested in learning about department stores, so she moved job to Lord + Taylor. </p>
